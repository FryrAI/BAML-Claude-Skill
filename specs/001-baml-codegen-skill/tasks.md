# Tasks: BAML Code Generation Skill

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-baml-codegen-skill/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as requested for validating the skill functionality

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `baml-claude-skill/` at repository root
- **Tests**: `tests/` at repository root
- **Documentation**: `specs/001-baml-codegen-skill/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and skill structure

- [X] T001 Create skill directory structure at baml-claude-skill/
- [X] T002 [P] Initialize SKILL.md with core structure (4000 token budget)
- [X] T003 [P] Create metadata.yaml with skill configuration
- [X] T004 [P] Set up cache directory structure at baml-claude-skill/cache/
- [X] T005 [P] Create lib directory for skill modules at baml-claude-skill/lib/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core MCP integration that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T007 Implement MCP interface base class in baml-claude-skill/lib/mcp_interface.md
- [X] T008 Create MCP query patterns for baml_Docs server in baml-claude-skill/lib/mcp_interface.md

- [X] T010 [P] Create pattern library data structure in baml-claude-skill/lib/pattern_library.md
- [X] T011 [P] Implement cache manager for query results in baml-claude-skill/lib/cache_manager.md
- [X] T012 Set up error handling and logging framework in baml-claude-skill/lib/utils.md

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 output but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Validates any generated code independently

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Core implementation before optimizations
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel after T007-T009 complete
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All template/example creation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create test for extraction requirement parsing in tests/unit/test_requirement_parser.py"
Task: "Create test for classification requirement parsing in tests/unit/test_requirement_parser.py"
Task: "Create integration test for end-to-end generation in tests/integration/test_generation_pipeline.py"

# After requirement parser (T016) and pattern matcher (T017) complete, launch generators in parallel:
Task: "Implement code synthesis engine in baml-claude-skill/lib/code_generator.md"
Task: "Create type generator for BAML types in baml-claude-skill/lib/code_generator.md#types"
Task: "Create function generator for BAML functions in baml-claude-skill/lib/code_generator.md#functions"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T013-T023)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T024-T034)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T035-T046)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (T047-T057)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Total tasks: 119 (7 setup + 6 foundational + 15 US1 + 19 US2 + 18 US3 + 15 US4 + 39 polish)
- Task ID format: T### with letter suffixes (a, b, c) for parallel sub-tasks added during refinement
