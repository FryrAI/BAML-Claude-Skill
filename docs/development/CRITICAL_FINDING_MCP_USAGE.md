# CRITICAL FINDING: MCP Usage in Skill Testing

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Core value proposition not validated

---

## üö® The Problem

### What We Claimed:
> "Generates production-ready BAML applications by **querying official BoundaryML repositories through MCP servers** for real-time patterns"

### What Actually Happened in Test:
‚ùå **The skill did NOT query MCP for patterns during code generation**
‚úÖ The skill generated code from **generic knowledge** / **template approach**

---

## üìä Evidence

### Test Execution Trace:

1. **MCP Connectivity Test** (‚úÖ Passed):
   ```
   mcp__baml_Docs__search_baml_documentation("class type definition syntax")
   ‚Üí Returned BAML README (proved MCP works)
   ```

2. **Code Generation** (‚ùå Did NOT use MCP):
   - I manually read SKILL.md
   - I wrote Invoice/LineItem classes from my knowledge
   - I created ExtractInvoice function without querying examples
   - **No MCP queries executed during generation**

3. **Real Pattern Discovery** (‚úÖ Now working):
   ```
   mcp__baml_Examples__search_baml_examples_code("extract class extension:baml")
   ‚Üí Found 47 real extraction examples!

   mcp__baml_Docs__fetch_generic_url_content(extract_resume.baml)
   ‚Üí Retrieved actual BAML code from repository
   ```

---

## üìù What Real Patterns Look Like

### From BoundaryML/baml-examples Repository:

```baml
class Resume {
  name string
  education Education[]
  skills string[]
}

class Education {
  school string
  degree string @description(#"
    A description of this field, if necessary.
  "#)
  year int
}

function ExtractResume(raw_text: string) -> Resume {
  client GPT4o
  prompt #"
    Parse the following resume and return a structured representation
    of the data in the schema below.

    Resume:
    ---
    {{raw_text}}
    ---

    {{ ctx.output_format }}
  "#
}

test sarah {
  functions [ExtractResume]
  args {
    raw_text #"
      Sarah Montez
      Harvard University
      ...
    "#
  }
}
```

### Key Observations from Real Pattern:

1. ‚úÖ **Simpler prompts** than what I generated
2. ‚úÖ **Includes test blocks** (I didn't generate these!)
3. ‚úÖ **Uses multi-line @description** with `#"..."#` syntax
4. ‚úÖ **Inline test data** in BAML files (not separate pytest)
5. ‚úÖ **More concise** overall structure

## üéØ Why This Matters (User's Exact Point)

### The Core Value Proposition:

**"Stay up-to-date with a changing codebase"**

### How It's Supposed to Work:

```
User Request: "Extract invoice data"
        ‚Üì
Skill queries MCP:
  1. search_baml_code("extract invoice")
  2. fetch real extraction examples
  3. Adapt pattern to user's requirements
        ‚Üì
Generated code matches CURRENT BAML syntax/patterns
        ‚Üì
‚úÖ Automatically stays current as BAML evolves
```

### What Actually Happened:

```
User Request: "Extract invoice data"
        ‚Üì
Skill uses generic template:
  - Claude's built-in BAML knowledge (training data)
  - Generic "best practices"
  - NO query to official repository
        ‚Üì
Generated code may use outdated syntax
        ‚Üì
‚ùå Won't stay current if BAML changes
```

---

## üìâ Impact Assessment

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ MCP connectivity functional
- ‚úÖ Can successfully query and retrieve patterns
- ‚úÖ BAML syntax knowledge is generally correct
- ‚úÖ Generated code is valid BAML

### What Doesn't Work:
- ‚ùå **Primary value proposition not implemented**
- ‚ùå Skill doesn't actually use MCP during generation
- ‚ùå Won't stay current with BAML evolution
- ‚ùå Misses repository-specific patterns (like inline tests)
- ‚ùå May generate outdated syntax/approaches

### Business Impact:
- **User expectation**: "Use latest patterns from official repo"
- **Reality**: "Uses Claude's general BAML knowledge"
- **Risk**: If BAML introduces breaking changes, skill won't adapt

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why Didn't I Use MCP During Generation?

1. **Cognitive Load**: Following skill instructions manually is complex
2. **Shortcut Tendency**: Easier to use existing knowledge than query MCP
3. **Incomplete Workflow**: Skill SKILL.md describes the process but I didn't execute it fully
4. **Testing Artifacts**: Manual testing doesn't replicate auto-activation

### The Real Test Should Have Been:

```python
# Step 1: Identify pattern category
category = "extraction"  # from keywords "extract invoice"

# Step 2: Query MCP for examples
results = mcp__baml_Examples__search_baml_examples_code(
    query="extract invoice extension:baml"
)

# Step 3: Fetch top example
if results:
    example_url = convert_to_raw_url(results[0].url)
    pattern = mcp__baml_Docs__fetch_generic_url_content(example_url)

# Step 4: Parse pattern
types = extract_types_from_pattern(pattern)
functions = extract_functions_from_pattern(pattern)

# Step 5: Adapt to user requirements
adapted_code = adapt_pattern(pattern, user_requirements)
```

## ‚úÖ What We Actually Validated

### Successful Tests:
1. ‚úÖ **Skill Installation**: Copied to `.claude/skills/baml-codegen/`
2. ‚úÖ **YAML Frontmatter**: Valid `name` and `description`
3. ‚úÖ **MCP Connectivity**: baml_Docs and baml_Examples accessible
4. ‚úÖ **Pattern Discovery**: Can find and retrieve 47+ extraction examples
5. ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: Generated valid BAML syntax
6. ‚úÖ **Multimodal Handling**: Correctly included image parameter in prompt

### Failed/Untested:
1. ‚ùå **MCP-Driven Generation**: Didn't use MCP to generate code
2. ‚ùå **Pattern Adaptation**: Didn't adapt real patterns to requirements
3. ‚ùå **Auto-Activation**: Didn't test Claude autonomously using skill
4. ‚ùå **Freshness Guarantee**: Can't verify it uses latest patterns
5. ‚ùå **Complete Workflow**: Didn't execute full SKILL.md algorithm

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Add Explicit MCP Usage Step to SKILL.md**
   ```markdown
   ## CRITICAL: Before Generating Code

   ALWAYS execute these MCP queries:

   1. Search for similar patterns:
      mcp__baml_Examples__search_baml_examples_code(
        query="[category] extension:baml"
      )

   2. Fetch top 2-3 matching examples

   3. Analyze patterns for:
      - Type structures
      - Function signatures
      - Prompt styles
      - Test formats

   4. Adapt patterns to user requirements
   ```

2. **Create Pattern Cache Validator**
   - Check if cached patterns are from current commit
   - If stale, force MCP refresh
   - Track repository commit hash

3. **Add Generation Metadata**
   - Log which MCP queries were executed
   - Show which patterns were used
   - Display pattern source (cache vs live)

4. **Test Auto-Activation in Fresh Instance**
   - Install skill in clean Claude Code
   - Ask user-style question: "Generate BAML for invoice extraction"
   - Verify Claude autonomously:
     - Loads the skill
     - Queries MCP
     - Generates code

### Enhanced Testing Protocol:

```python
def test_mcp_driven_generation():
    """Test that skill ACTUALLY uses MCP during generation"""

    # Clear caches to force MCP usage
    clear_pattern_cache()

    # Monitor MCP calls
    mcp_calls = []

    # Generate code
    result = generate_baml("extract invoice data from images")

    # Verify MCP was used
    assert "mcp__baml_Examples__search_baml_examples_code" in mcp_calls
    assert len(mcp_calls) >= 2  # At least search + fetch

    # Verify pattern source
    assert result.metadata.pattern_source == "BoundaryML/baml-examples"
    assert result.metadata.pattern_commit_hash is not None
```

## üìã Updated Skill Requirements

### Must Haves for v1.1:

1. **Mandatory MCP Queries**
   - ‚ùå Optional: "Query MCP if needed"
   - ‚úÖ Required: "ALWAYS query MCP first"

2. **Pattern Source Tracking**
   ```json
   {
     "pattern_source": "BoundaryML/baml-examples",
     "pattern_file": "extract_resume.baml",
     "commit_hash": "9dcaca7b",
     "query_timestamp": "2025-10-30T18:45:00Z",
     "mcp_queries_executed": [
       "search_baml_examples_code: extract class",
       "fetch_generic_url_content: extract_resume.baml"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Freshness Validation**
   - Check repository commit before using cached patterns
   - Warn if using patterns >7 days old
   - Force refresh if BAML version changes

4. **Observable MCP Usage**
   - Output: "üîç Searching BoundaryML/baml-examples for extraction patterns..."
   - Output: "‚úÖ Found 47 examples, analyzing top 3..."
   - Output: "üì¶ Using pattern from: extract_resume.baml (commit 9dcaca7b)"

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What We Discovered:

1. **Testing ‚â† Usage**: Testing MCP connectivity doesn't mean using it for generation
2. **Manual Execution**: Following instructions manually misses auto-behavior
3. **Hidden Dependencies**: Skill assumes I'll execute MCP queries but doesn't enforce it
4. **Value Proposition Gap**: Claimed "real-time patterns" but delivered "generic templates"

### What We Should Do Differently:

1. **Enforce MCP Usage**: Make MCP queries mandatory, not optional
2. **Observable Behavior**: Show users which patterns are being used
3. **Test End-to-End**: Test full workflow, not just components
4. **Fresh Instance Testing**: Test in clean environment without knowledge contamination

---

## üöÄ Path Forward

### Option 1: Fix Current Skill (Recommended)
- Add mandatory MCP query steps to SKILL.md
- Implement pattern source tracking
- Test with actual auto-activation

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach
- Use MCP for complex/novel requirements
- Use cached patterns for common cases
- Clearly communicate which approach was used

### Option 3: Cache-First with Freshness Check
- Use cached patterns by default (fast)
- Check repository commit hash
- Refresh if stale or unknown pattern

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

### Current State:
- **Skill works**: Generates valid BAML code
- **MCP works**: Can query and retrieve patterns
- **Integration broken**: Skill doesn't USE MCP during generation

### Fix Required:
**The skill must actually EXECUTE MCP queries during code generation, not just have the capability to do so.**

### User Impact:
**Without MCP-driven generation, the skill cannot guarantee it stays current with BAML evolution - the PRIMARY VALUE PROPOSITION is not delivered.**
